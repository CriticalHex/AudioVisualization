This project depends on SFML, fftw (Fastest Fourier Transform in the West), and my own WASAPI integration, available at https://github.com/CriticalHex/AudioProcessing.

As you can tell from the Makefile, this program expects AudioProcessing to be in a folder called WASAPI adjacent to this project's root directory, but that is of course changable.
